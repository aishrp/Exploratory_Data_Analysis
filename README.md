# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project is an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the famous Titanic dataset. The goal of the project was to uncover insights, identify patterns, and prepare the data for potential predictive modeling by performing thorough data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

## Key Steps

### Data Cleaning & Preparation:
Handled missing values using median and mode imputation.

Removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Univariate Analysis: Used histograms and summary statistics to explore individual features.

Bivariate Analysis: Employed box plots, violin plots, and correlation matrices to examine relationships between variables.

Multivariate Analysis: Utilized pair plots and heatmaps to understand how multiple features interact, especially in relation to survival.

Data Visualization: Visualized data distributions, correlations, and survival outcomes using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Visualizations
The project includes several key visualizations:
Histograms: To explore the distribution of key features like age, fare, and passenger class.

Box Plots & Violin Plots: To identify outliers and compare feature distributions across survival outcomes.

Correlation Heatmaps: To visualize correlations between numerical features.

Pair Plots: To analyze the interactions between features and their relation to survival.

## Insights & Findings
Age Distribution: Younger passengers had higher survival rates, while middle-aged passengers were less likely to survive.

Fare & Class: Passengers in higher classes (1st class) with higher fares had better chances of survival.

Family Size: Smaller family sizes were generally associated with better survival odds, highlighting the importance of social dynamics on the ship.

## Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: For documenting and executing the EDA process.
